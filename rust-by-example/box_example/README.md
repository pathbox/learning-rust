All values in Rust are stack allocated by default. `Values can be boxed (allocated on the heap) by creating a Box<T>. A box is a smart pointer to a heap allocated value of type T. When a box goes out of scope, its destructor is called, the inner object is destroyed, and the memory on the heap is freed`.

Boxed values can be dereferenced using the * operator; this removes one layer of indirection.
